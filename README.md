# Travel Tracker

## About

Travel Tracker is an application which allows the user to track trips (past, current and upcoming), schedule new trips, and . This application interacts with an API using webpack and implements SRP and OOP practices including a robust testing suite and full fetch functionality. Accessibility has been considered using an audit by Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse. 

This is a solo project by [Delilah Necrason.](https://github.com/delilahrois)

In a separate terminal window, clone down [this API.](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)

Then run `npm install` and `npm start` inside the API directory.

## Future Iterations

- Ability to keep a friends list, add friends to trips / share friends' access to the trips board
- Ability to interact with friends' trips with likes, etc.
