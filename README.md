## About

Travel Tracker is an application which allows the user to track trips (past, current and upcoming), schedule new trips / see their estimated costs, and track their total spent on trips annually. This application interacts with an API using Webpack and implements best SRP and OOP practices including a robust testing suite and full fetch functionality, both GET and POST. Accessibility has been considered using an audit by Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse. 

This is a solo project by [Delilah Necrason.](https://github.com/delilahrois) 

## Setup

To set up Travel Tracker, clone down this repo by running `git clone git@github.com:delilahrois/travel-tracker.git`. Then run `npm install`. Once all dependencies are installed, run `npm start`. 

In a separate terminal window, clone down [this API.](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)

Then run `npm install` and `npm start` inside the API directory. 

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser. 

You will now be able to use Travel Tracker.

## Future Iterations

In future iterations of this project, additions to consider would be:

- A map to show the traveler's prior trips on a global scale
- Ability to keep a friends list, add friends to trips / share friends' access to the trips board
- Ability to interact with friends' trips with likes, etc.
